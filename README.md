Fixing Errors Due to Device not Being Found:
```Error instantiating RTE components
Error #543: Device MK64FN1M0xxx12(NXP) not found, pack 'Keil.Kinetis_K60_DFP' is not installed
Error #540: 'Keil::Device:Startup:1.0.0' component is not available for target 'Target 1'```

Change the device from NXP K64F (1M) to Freescale K64F (1M) depending on Keil version
